# NLP_Final
Final project for my NLP class at Stevens Institute of Technology. An analysis of various roBERTa models performance on the Contradictory My Dear Watson Kaggle NLI task.

### File Structure
The Google Colab directory is where I grabbed the models off of hugging face, performed a parameter search then fine-tuned on the best parameters found. The Kaggle directory contains the code that performed the predictions. 

### Notes
The PDF is my report and contains more details on the methedology and results of the project.
